    "This was another experiment with ensemble boosting, where we used three models: LightGBM, XGBoost, and Catboost. In this code, we used rough fine tuning on a smaller subset of the data to get a general idea of the hyperparameters, then did finer fine tuning on a larger subset of the data with the hyperparameters we got from the last step. Then, we did ensemble voting between the three models. We started with just average, and then moved to a weighted average for the voting. This set used color bucketing, breed bucketing, and age to weeks for preprocessing, similar to most of the others.\n"
